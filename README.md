# fair learning without sensitive attributes
Official code for WSDM 2022 paper: [Towards Fair Classifiers Without Sensitive Attributes: Exploring Biases in Related Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14537)


## Dataset
Two datasets, Law_school and Compas, are provided in this project. 

## Algorithm
We provide several algorithms for fair learning: 
- corre: constrain correlation with sensitive attributes 
- groupTPR: regularize group-wise true positive rate for fairness 
- remove: remove related attributes  
- learnCorre: learn to constrain correlation with related attributes 

## Example
An example on adult dataset is provided here: 

<code>python main.py --method="learnCorre" --dataset=adult --related age --r_weight 0.1 --weightSum=0.1  --beta=0.4 --seed=42</code>
